Documentation of Customized Linux Shell

Shell starts by welcoming the user and at every prompt tells us that you are working at what directory.
Shell supports 5 internal commands that are:-
	1). echo , and  echo -n 
	2). cd  , and has all the options available for cd.(cd .. , cd ../.. , cd Dir1/Dir2).
	3). pwd 
	4). history 
	5). exit

Shell also supports various external commands including:-
	1). ls , and has all the options for ls available(including ls- a,ls -r,ls -h)
	2). mkdir ,and has 2 options available(including mkdir -v)
	3). rm , and has 2 options available(including rm -v ,rm -i) 
	4). date and has 2 options (date -R , date -u)
	5). cat and has 2 options available (including cat -n and cat -t)

Shell also has all the man pages.
When exit is commanded , the shell greets the user and exits(going back to terminal)


Corner Cases
	1). Echo can have a lot of spaces in between 2 inverted commas , so I consider all the spaces.
	2). In case of input a person can put a lot of spaces between 2 options such as (date        -R) but it will be considered as (date -R)
	3). In case a person writes 2 arguements together such as (date -Ru) or if he writes them seperately (date -R -u) , the shell will treat them the same.

Assumptions
	1).For external commands my shell takes only 2 options at a time.
	2).echo only has 1 option that I gave which is echo -n which cuts the extra line.
	3). Commands such as pwd , history and exit which don't require any option , don't have one.

Testcases
Open using ./a.out
echo "    Vishesh      Agrawal"
echo -n "Hello "
date -R -u
pwd
cd
mkdir -v viss 
ls    -ar
touch van.txt
cat van.txt
cat -n van.txt
rm -vi van.txt
ls
history
exit
